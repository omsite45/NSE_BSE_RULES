Question,Answer
According to Association of NSE IFSC Limited what are the terms for Authorised Share Capital ?,"According to the Articles of Association of NSE IFSC Limited, the authorized share capital is the maximum number of shares a company can issue, as stated in its Memorandum of Association. This amount can be increased or reduced in accordance with the company's regulations and relevant legal provisions. It essentially sets the limit on how much capital the company can raise through share issuance"
"According to Association of NSE IFSC Limited under SHARE CAPITAL section, whats is Restriction on allotment  ?","Let me start by recalling what the search results mentioned. 
First, I need to focus on the regulatory framework. Among these search results, 10 talks about the SEBI guidelines for IFSC and the Companies Act amendments. It mentions the Direct Listing Scheme and eligibility criteria for issuers. That's probably relevant because allotment restrictions would tie into who can issue shares and who can hold them.
Next, looking at 12, it lists registered brokers and mentions that Indian retail investors can trade via depository receipts. But the user's question is about share capital allotment, not trading. So maybe the restrictions are related to who can be allotted shares, like permissible holders. 10 specifies that only non-residents can hold shares listed on International Stock Exchanges, which aligns with the Foreign Exchange Management Act rules. That's a key point.
Also, 10 discusses the Direct Listing Scheme's eligibility requirements. Companies with negative net worth, defaults, or under winding up can't issue shares. Promoters and directors must not be fugitive economic offenders. These are restrictions on the issuer side. 
Then, there's the lock-in period for anchor investors mentioned in 10. They have a 90-day lock-in for 50% of their allotted IDRs. This is a restriction on transferring shares after allotment. 
Fractional ownership through depository receipts is covered in 13, where HDFC Bank holds the underlying shares. But the user's question is about share capital, so the restriction here is that investors get receipts, not direct shares. This indirect ownership structure limits their rights, like voting. 
I should also consider the sectoral caps from FEMA rules. 10 notes that holdings must adhere to foreign investment limits, which would affect allotment if sectors have caps. 
Putting this together, the restrictions are multi-faceted: issuer eligibility, holder eligibility, lock-ins, and structural limitations via depository receipts. The user might be looking for compliance details, possibly for legal or investment purposes. They might need to understand barriers to issuing or acquiring shares in NSE IFSC. Ensuring each restriction is clearly explained with the right citations from 10,12,13 will cover their query"

Stamped and attested: Signatures require witness attestation to prevent fraud 15.

Submitted with physical share certificates: Essential for dematerializing shares into electronic form 15.

? 2. Electronic Transfers (Demat Accounts)

"According to Association of NSE IFSC Limited how can Directors may refuse to register transfers ?,""","Based on the search results, directors of **NSE IFSC Limited** (or any public company) may refuse to register share transfers under specific legal frameworks and procedural conditions. Here is a synthesized analysis:

---

### ?? **1. Legal Grounds for Refusal**
- **""Sufficient Cause"" (Indian Companies Act, 2013)**  
  Directors may refuse registration if the transfer violates:
  - **Company's interests**: e.g., transfers to competitors creating conflicts of interest .
  - **Contractual obligations**: Breach of shareholders' agreements or articles of association .
  - **Legal violations**: Contravention of SEBI regulations, foreign investment rules, or other laws .
  - *Key Precedent*: *Mackintosh Burn Ltd v. Sarkar & Chowdhury (2018)* upheld refusal due to competitor risk .

- **Articles of Association (AoA)**  
  Refusal is valid if transfers violate pre-emption clauses, transfer restrictions (e.g., lock-ins), or approval procedures specified in the AoA .  
  *Example*: Lush Cosmetics refused a 19.8% stake transfer for non-compliance with its AoA .

---

### ?? **2. Procedural Requirements for Valid Refusal**
- **Board Resolution**: Directors must formally resolve to refuse registration—inaction or silence is insufficient .
- **Timely Notification**:  
  - Refusal notices must be sent to **transferor/transferee within 2 months** of transfer lodgment .
  - Reasons must be provided within **28 days** if requested .
- **Documentation**: Maintain evidence supporting ""sufficient cause"" (e.g., conflict of interest, legal non-compliance) .

---

### ?? **3. Consequences of Improper Refusal**
- **Court Intervention**: Transferees may challenge refusals in court/NCLT. Courts may order registration if:
  - Refusal lacked **bona fide intent** or violated procedures .
  - Grounds were unsubstantiated (e.g., *Hero Rich International Ltd*, where allegations were unsupported) .
- **Beneficial Interest Transfer**: Refusal blocks legal title transfer, but **beneficial ownership** may still pass to the transferee. Sellers then hold shares as trustees .

---

### ??? **4. Practical Safeguards for Directors**
1. **Verify AoA Compliance**: Ensure transfers align with pre-emption rights, approval mechanisms, and restrictions .
2. **Assess Broader Impacts**: Document how transfers harm company interests (e.g., reputational risks, competitor advantage) .  
   *Example*: In *Cheng Chien Kuo*, refusal was upheld due to transferee's alleged criminal ties .
3. **Follow Due Process**:  
   - Hold valid board meetings with quorum .  
   - Issue detailed refusal reasons to avoid invalidation (e.g., *Re Redford*) .
4. **Mitigate Buyer Risks**: Use powers of attorney to let transferees exercise share rights pending disputes .

---

### ?? **Key Takeaway**  
Directors of NSE IFSC Limited may refuse share transfers **only if**:  
> (i) Grounds fall under ""sufficient cause"" (conflict of interest, illegality) **or** AoA violations;  
> (ii) Procedures (notices, board resolutions) are strictly followed; and  
> (iii) Decisions prioritize the **company's best interests** with documented evidence .  
Failure in any aspect risks court-mandated registration and liability. For entity-specific rules, consult **NSE IFSC's Articles of Association** and SEBI/IFSCA regulations.."""

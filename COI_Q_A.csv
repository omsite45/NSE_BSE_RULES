Question,Answer
According to MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF NSE IFSC LIMITED what you mean by 'Authorised Share Capital' ?,"According to the Association of NSE IFSC Limited, **Authorised Share Capital** refers to the maximum amount of share capital that the company is legally permitted to issue, as specified in its constitutional documents (such as the **Memorandum of Association**). This cap is set during incorporation and can be modified only through shareholder approval and regulatory compliance. Key aspects include:  

1. **Definition**: It represents the upper limit of capital NSE IFSC can raise via equity shares, calculated as the number of authorised shares multiplied by their face value (e.g., ?10 per share) .  
2. **Purpose**: It enables future fundraising flexibility (e.g., for expansion or acquisitions) without repeated regulatory amendments, while protecting shareholders from uncontrolled dilution of ownership .  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Exceeding this limit requires a **special resolution** passed by shareholders and approval from regulatory bodies like the National Company Law Tribunal .  
4. **NSE IFSC Example**: As of June 2024, NSE IFSC's authorised capital stood at **?1,50,00,00,000** (1.5 billion rupees), with issued capital at ?75,00,00,000—half the authorised limit . This demonstrates strategic reserve capacity for future issuance.  

In essence, authorised capital serves as a **statutory ceiling** for equity financing, balancing operational flexibility with investor protection ."
"According to MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF NSE IFSC LIMITED under SHARE CAPITAL section, whats are the Restriction on allotment of shares contained in Section 39  ?","Based on the provisions of **Section 39 of the Companies Act, 2013** (, the restrictions on the allotment of securities (including shares) are as follows:

1.  **Minimum Subscription Requirement**: No allotment can be made unless the minimum amount stated in the prospectus as necessary for the company's operations has been fully subscribed.  
2.  **Payment of Application Amounts**: The company must have actually received the sums payable on application for that minimum stated amount through cheque or other valid instruments (.  
3.  **Minimum Application Value**: The amount payable on application for each security cannot be less than **5% of its nominal value** (or a different percentage/amount specified by SEBI) (.  
4.  **Refund Obligation for Failure**: If the minimum subscription amount is not received within **30 days** (or a SEBI-specified period) from the prospectus issue date, the company must return all application money received within the prescribed time and manner (.  
5.  **Penalty for Default**: Failure to refund application money (as per Subsection 3) or to file the return of allotment (as per Subsection 4) makes the company and every defaulting officer liable to a penalty of **?1,000 per day** (or a maximum of **?1 lakh**, whichever is less) for each default (.  

These restrictions ensure investor protection by tying allotment to genuine capital-raising success and mandating refunds if minimum thresholds are unmet, backed by financial penalties for non-compliance."
"According to MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF NSE IFSC LIMITED in certificates section, what are the Member’s right to Certificates?","Based on the provided search results and standard corporate governance practices for entities like NSE IFSC Limited, the rights of Members regarding Certificates (typically referring to Membership Certificates) are governed by the company's Articles of Association. While the exact text of NSE IFSC's Articles is not fully detailed in the search results, the following rights are universally implied in such frameworks and are consistent with the membership application context:

1.  **Issuance Upon Admission:** A successfully admitted member has the right to receive a Membership Certificate issued by NSE IFSC Limited as formal proof of their membership status and the rights attached thereto .
2.  **Evidence of Rights:** The Certificate serves as prima facie evidence of the member's entitlement to exercise the trading, clearing, and other operational privileges granted under the membership category approved by the exchange and its clearing corporation .
3.  **Conditional Transfer:** While physical possession of the certificate exists, the *right* to freely transfer or deal with the membership represented by the certificate is typically heavily restricted. Transfer usually requires prior written approval from the exchange/clearing corporation and must comply strictly with the procedures outlined in the Articles of Association and relevant regulations. The certificate itself is not a freely negotiable instrument .

**Important Note:** The specific, detailed rights and obligations related to Membership Certificates (including exact transfer procedures, fees, conditions for re-issuance if lost, and surrender upon termination) are definitively contained within the full Memorandum and Articles of Association (M&A) of NSE IFSC Limited. The application form () is a related document but does not itself reproduce the complete M&A clauses concerning certificates.

5.  **Condition for Ownership:** Compliance with dematerialisation is a **fundamental condition** for acquiring and maintaining ownership of equity shares in NSE IFSC Limited .

"According to MEMORANDUM AND ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION OF NSE IFSC LIMITED under ""TRANSFER AND TRANSMISSION OF SHARES"" , what is ""Execution of instrument of transfer""?","Based on the provided search results, the **exact text** of the ""Execution of instrument of transfer"" clause from the NSE IFSC Limited's Memorandum and Articles of Association (MOA/AOA) is **not included**.

Here is the explanation of ""Execution of instrument of transfer"" as it typically applies in such documents:

2.  **Document Requirements**: This instrument must comply with formats specified in the Companies Act, exchange rules (e.g., SGX Rule 3.2.2 ), and NSE IFSC's own AOA. It usually includes details like the transferor/transferee names, share quantity, distinctive numbers, and consideration.
3.  **Transferor's Responsibility**: The **current shareholder** (or their legally authorized representative) must duly sign and often have their signature witnessed as per the AOA requirements.
4.  **Transferee's Role**: While the transferor executes the transfer, the **transferee** typically also signs the instrument to signify acceptance of the shares and agreement to be bound by the AOA.
5.  **Company's Role**: NSE IFSC may stipulate conditions in its AOA for approving the transfer (e.g., Board approval for restricted shares, compliance with securities laws). The executed instrument must be submitted to the company for registration.
6.  **Constitutive Document Alignment**: As per SGX Rule 3.2.2, NSE IFSC's AOA must ensure this process enables members to fulfill their regulatory obligations and must be amended if inconsistent with exchange rules .

**In essence**: It is the **act of properly signing the legal document** that initiates the formal process of transferring share ownership, subject to the company's regulations and applicable laws. The specific procedural details (e.g., stamping, witness requirements) would be defined in the full text of NSE IFSC's AOA, which is not provided in the search results."
